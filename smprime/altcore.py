"""
The second implementation, kept deliberately unlike the first.

This file is used to check `core`: if the two disagree on any instance,
one of them is wrong.  `scripts/crosscheck.py` runs the comparison.

INDEPENDENT second implementation of the reachable-state graph of serial
proposer-proposing deferred acceptance (DA), written from the mathematical
definition only.  Deliberately different from graph_audit_independent.py:

  * state is encoded RECEIVER-SIDE:  (holder, ptr)
        holder[r] = proposer currently held by receiver r, or -1
        ptr[p]    = number of proposals p has already made
    (the audited code encodes matching PROPOSER-side, m[p] = receiver of p)
  * exploration is BFS with an explicit deque (audited code: DFS via list.pop)
  * receiver preferences are consumed as explicit rank matrices built here
  * active/enabled set is recomputed from `holder` rather than from `m`

Supports incomplete lists (pref lists may be shorter than the receiver set)
and unbalanced instances.
